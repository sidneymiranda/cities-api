# Cities API

<hr>

## Descripition

This project is about a REST API developed during the Java Developer bootcamp of Digital Innovation One. In it, some endpoints were implemented, such as: the consultation of countries and more specifically in Brazil, which is possible:

- Consult the states
- Consult the cities
- Check the distance between two cities
    - In Km
    - In Miles
    


## Tools and technologies used
- IntellijIDEA
- Postman
- Java 8
- Spring Boot
- Spring Data JPA
- PostgreSQL
- Heroku
- Project Lombok
- Hibernate Types Library


## Learning

I matured a little more about the use of Spring Boot.
I was able to work with pagination very easily using the Spring Framework
Handling the Java 8 Stream API
Layered design architecture
- Entity
- Resource
- Repository
- Service

## Challenge

- I intend to implement new features for the API, such as calculating the distance between neighborhoods in a city, for example (just an idea).
- A new project as an application that consumes this API.
